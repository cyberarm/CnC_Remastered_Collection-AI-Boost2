-Aftermath Fast Build works?
-Speed rush works?
-Instant capture works?
-Chronosphere doesnt kill cargo?
-Groundwar/Navalwar and mixed war still correct detection?
-AI extra base on waypoint still works?
-AI protects MCV's going to waypoints?
-AI MAD-tanks still deploy?
-Chrono tanks group/ungroup jumping still correct?
-AI new missions work? (Attack factories, Power, defense, etc.)


To do: (All)
-Check all options in the .ini file (some are obsolete, some are missing)
-Check the README.md 
-Scan the map to find the number of Tiberium left to harvester (this so we can determin if extra refs, etc. are usefull or that we are in end-fase of the game)
-Scan the map for water fields, if more than x, its automatically enables naval war.
-Scan the map for rocks and other blockades to know the AI must boosted extra to compensate space problems.
-Split house building prio's in seperate VOIDs for better strategies/buildlimits for rush tactics etc.


To do for Bast75:
-Center of base must be set to all bases to make sure AI builds on all of them. If not possible, recalculate on new base only
-Prio for base defense set to half, if chronosphere, iron curtain, nuke ready, then defense limits to max? (This so those buildings will be produced faster)
-New mission: Gather at enemy base (out of range), wait a minute and then attack.
-New mission: Attack Factories
-New mission: Attack Power Plants
-New mission: Attack defense (with Artillery units)
-Create new image for new Steam release: AI-Boost 3.0


To do for Mini Franki:
-Chronoshift MCV should use the Chronosphere with timer, etc.
-Find way to load the MCV on a transport, then we can send it to a waypoint to unload.
-Find way to load other units on a transport, then we can send it to a waypoint (gather at enemy?) to unload and attack/capture enemy stuff.
-Send a X percentage of units to guard MCV to help him to reach the waypoint destination successfully and to have some defense for the new base


Idea's for the future:
-AI should break/start an friendship on certain events.
-Add a map in the mod thats shows all AI potentials? Naval, 2nd base, Chronosphere MCV, etc.



Done (Need to be added to README.md if important enough):
-AI uses startpositions/waypoints to start extra base(s)
-AI MCV should not deploy premature when damage is not red -> no deploy, calls for help
-Harvester memory option back in code
-Iron curtain tweaks -> already ready. Iron Curtain recharge is high, so we only want to protect important things when its ready
-MCV deploy should increase the limits. What limits exactly? Editable in .ini?
-Airstrip/airpad code to check
-Selling/power list tweak
-Chronosphere code need rework

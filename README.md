Please re-subscribe to download the newest version.

This is my personal AI-Boost mod for RA.
I've added some changes to improve the AI on top of the Rampastring Quality of Live MOD. (waypoints, etc.)

The AI handles his cash flow and building priorities/limits a lot smarter.
It doesn't wait for the player to let his base grow and/or tech up to the highest level.
The AI monitors what you are doing and uses this on how to react while upgrading his base.
More Factories, Air stuff, Air defence, Naval stuff or Refineries if you have created more of this.
Etc.
It's totally dynamic. :-)

It now also produces/uses the following:
Demo truck, Chrono Tank, Kennel/Dog, MAD Tank, Flamethrower, Shock Troopers, Medic, Mechanic, Spy, Thief, Gap generator, repair bay and the Nuclear Missile Silo.
And yes, Naval stuff works also.
At a certain point, it creates an MCV and depoys it close to Tiberium to start a extra base.

Note:
The more Tiberium is available on the map, the harder it gets to beat this AI.
You might need a faster pc because of the amount of units etc.  :-)

Extra changes:
-Sight range of the MCV is increased, this was needed to get the AI to find a deploy spot.
-Instant capture with Engineer. No damage to building(s)
-ChronoKillCargo set to False. Chronoshifting APCs or transports will not kill any passengers or cargo.
-AI's MCV goes to tiberium and deploys there for extra base, AI limitations for buildings, etc. will grow on each MCV deployment.
-AI scans for human Naval objects, if he detects a Naval stuff, it will upscale his Naval and Air stuff.
-AI lowers tank production if human goes naval and GroundWar is disabled. (Allies still build Chronotanks beacause they can Chronoshift)
-AI knows how to use Thiefs and Spies.
-AI attacks interval uses different ways. (Hunt, Closest enemy, etc.)
-AI Air units no longer just attack Refineries, it selects random between basedefence, factories, power, buildings, naval units or all threats.
-AI Scatters all units on new attack launch to unlock stuck/blocked units.
-AI understands importants of buildings & units a lot better and uses it during attack.
-AI Knows how to use a MAD Tank.
-AI Knows how to use chronoshifting with a Chrono Tank.
-AI Engineers no longer walk in groups. They choose his own targets
-AI Customizable limits for nr of AI buildings, tanks, etc.

-AI Boost level and almost all other setttings are editable using the .ini file. It's located in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\1213210\2221741447\AIBoost\CCDATA\AIBOOST.INI



To do / whishes:
-AI Minelayer control
-AI Chronosphere control in Skirmish
-AI Iron Curton control in Skirmish
-Veterancy for al units!!! (Source code anyone? Github?)
-Change the menu for additional AI levels and game modes. (Source code anyone? Github?)
-Attack Move command integration. (Source code anyone? Github?)
-New Units & Buildings available after capturing buildings from other party (Allies vs Soviet)


Known issues:
-AI strenght is depending on map layout. Some maps it's still not good. Other maps its almost impossible to beat.


Greetings, have fun and don't forget to rate my mod.

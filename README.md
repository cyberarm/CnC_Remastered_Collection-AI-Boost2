This is my personal AI-Boost mod for RA.
I've added some changes to improve the AI on top of several other mods like:
-Aftermath fast build MOD (Use .ini to enable/disable)
-AttackMove MOD (Use Shift)
-The Rampastring Quality of Live MOD. (waypoints, etc.)
-Engineer instant capture
-Engineers automatically choose new target after capturing.
-Additional Zoom Levels
-RA Immersive Helis Mod (And all Air units have a sight) (Use L to land)
-Tech stealing by capturing a building with an Engineer (Allies vs Soviets)
-Harvester have memory of latest harvest location, this is now editable by .ini file
-Now its possible to have more starting cash! Use the slider.
-You can now remove toggle with space between old/new graphic in gameconstant.xml.
 It changes nothing on engine performance so still rendering in the background
-Added the option to remove shroud from the map

-AI knows how to use Thiefs and Spies.
-AI knows how to use a MAD Tank.
-AI knows how to use chronoshifting with a Chrono Tank.
-AI knows how to use Naval stuff.
-AI attacks interval uses different ways. (Hunt, Closest enemy, etc.)
-AI Scatters all units on new attack launch to unlock stuck/blocked units.
-AI Air units no longer just attack Refineries, it selects random between basedefence, factories, power, buildings, naval units or all threats.
-AI understands importants of buildings & units a lot better and uses it during attack.
-AI Engineers no longer walk in groups. They choose his own targets
-AI Customizable limits for nr of AI buildings, tanks, etc.
-AI handles his cash flow and building priorities/limits a lot smarter.
-AI doesn't wait for the player to let his base grow and/or tech up to the highest level.
-AI's MCV goes to tiberium and deploys there for extra base, AI limitations for buildings, etc. will grow on each MCV deployment.
-AI scans for human Naval objects, if he detects a Naval stuff, it will upscale his Naval and Air stuff.
-AI lowers tank production if human goes naval and GroundWar is disabled. (Allies still build Chronotanks beacause they can Chronoshift)
-AI Medics and Mechanics now only repairs friendly units.

-The AI monitors what you are doing and uses this on how to react while upgrading his base.
More Factories, Air stuff, Air defence, Naval stuff or Refineries if you have created more of this.
Etc.
It's totally dynamic. :-)


Note:
The more Tiberium is available on the map, the harder it gets to beat this AI.
You might need a faster pc because of the amount of units etc.  :-)

Extra changes:
-Sight range of the MCV is increased, this was needed to get the AI to find a deploy spot.
-ChronoKillCargo set to False. Chronoshifting APCs or transports will not kill any passengers or cargo.
-The number of starting units & starting cash can be changed using the .ini file.

-AI Boost level and almost all other setttings are editable using the .ini file. It's located in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\1213210\2221741447\AIBoost\CCDATA\AIBOOST.INI


To do / whishes:
-AI Minelayer control
-AI Chronosphere control in Skirmish
-AI Iron Curton control in Skirmish
-Change the menu for additional AI levels and game modes. (Source code anyone? Github?)


Known issues:
-AI strenght is depending on map layout. Some maps it's still not good. Other maps its almost impossible to beat.
-Tech stealing: The human player has to re-deploy the Construction Yard to MCV and back to unlock all stolen tech. Also for the War Factory. (Or you have to build a extra one)


Greetings, have fun and don't forget to rate my mod.

	"description": "# AI-Boost for Red Alert\r\nLast update at: 14 may 2022\r\n\r\nPlease follow the steps below to update and reactivate the mod:\r\n- Disable the mod in the Mods Menu\r\n- Unsubscribe from the mod in the in-game Workshop Mods menu\r\n- Quit and restart the game\r\n- Re-subscribe to the mod via the Workshop Mods menu\r\n- Activate the mod and restart the game as prompted\r\n- The updated mod should then work as intended\r\n\r\nNew:\r\n- Added a lot more info in the INI about how AIBoost work (to avoid confusion)\r\n- AIBoostLevel is dynamic by the number of enemies/friendlies he personally sees, to re-balance unfair groups (Can be enabled/disabled/tweaked using the .ini file.)\r\n- You can now set the boost for your allies and your enemies independently (when dynamic AI boost is disabled)\r\n- Free-For-All detection, it automatically disables Dynamic AI in these cases because there are no teams so nothing to re-balance\r\n- A lot of tweaks which greatly increases the AI intelligence (See new options in the .ini file also)\r\n- AI build more air defenses and GAP generators\r\n- AI selling buildings to restore power or cash is smarter now\r\n- Tweaked the building/defense order/priority resulting in better cash flow/cost for the AI\r\n \r\nFixed:\r\n- Sometimes harvesters could go to the other side of the map instead of going to the nearest Tiberium field. It's fixed now (Thanks to Cyberarm)\r\n- AI keeps building harvesters in some situations. Now you can set a max limit in the .ini file\r\n- The AI Chronotanks no longer jumps in groups. Human is unable to do this, so it was unfair. You can re-enable group-jumps by the .ini file if you like\r\n- AI naval production was unlimited. An AI tried to build more ships than all other enemies combined, resulting in unlimited production. Now it counts the human ships only\r\n- AI building production was unlimited when having multiple enemies. Now it calculates the average buildings of all enemies and use this as baseline\r\n- AI made too many engineers. Now there is a limit in the .ini file\r\n- AIAttackFirstTime (in the .ini), now it works!\r\n- MCV are a lot smarter now. Find-good-deploy-spot search area is greatly increased so when they leave the war factory, they go straight to the point. They dont get stuck anymore\r\n- GAP selling loop for the AI is fixed\r\n- Fixed the recalculation of certain building limits when AI steals technology\r\n- We bring back the way MCV is deployed. AI don't like it to be too close near the tiberium (Bases are more compacted, more stuck units, less effective bases defenses, etc)\r\n- Added a fix on RA Immersive Heli's mod\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nIncluded Mod's:\r\n- The Rampastring Quality of Live MOD. (way-points, etc.)\r\n- Engineer instant capture\r\n- Additional Zoom Levels\r\n- RA Immersive Heli's Mod (And all Air units have a sight) (Use 'L' to land)\r\n- Attack-Move MOD (Use Shift)\r\n- Aftermath fast build MOD (Use .ini to enable/disable)\r\n- ChronoKillCargo set to False. Chronoshifting APCs or transports will not kill any passengers or cargo\r\n- Added the option to remove shroud from the map\r\n\r\nOwn Mod's:\r\n- Tech stealing by capturing a building with an Engineer (Allies vs Soviets)\r\n- Sight range of the MCV is increased, this was needed to get the AI to find a deploy spot\r\n- Now it's possible to add more starting cash and units! Editable by the .ini file\r\n- You can now remove toggle with space between old/new graphic in gameconstant.xml\r\n- Harvesters have memory of latest harvest location, this is now editable by .ini file\r\n- Added extra zoom levels to the mod: \"Additional Zoom Levels\"\r\n\r\nAI changes:\r\n- AI handles his cash flow and building priorities/limits a lot smarter\r\n- AI customizable limits for number of AI buildings, tanks, etc. using the .ini file\r\n- AI scatters all units on new attack launch to unlock stuck/blocked units\r\n- AI understands importance of buildings & units a lot better and uses it during attack\r\n- AI attacks interval uses different ways (Hunt, Closest enemy, etc.)\r\n- AI Air units no longer just attack Refineries, it selects random between base-defense, factories, power, buildings, naval units or all threats\r\n- AI knows how to use Thief's, Spies, MAD Tanks, Demo truck and chrono shifting with a Chrono Tank\r\n- AI knows how to use Naval stuff\r\n- AI Naval war detection. The AI scans for human Naval objects, if he detects Naval stuff, it will upscale his Naval and Air limits\r\n- AI lowers tank production if human goes naval and doesn't produce a lot of tanks (Still builds Chronotanks because they can Chronoshift)\r\n- AI Engineers automatically choose new target after capturing or loosing focus on previous selected target\r\n- AI Engineers no longer walk in groups. They choose their own targets\r\n- AI Medics and Mechanics now only repair friendly units\r\n- AI doesn't wait for the player to let his base grow and/or tech up to the highest level (Radar, Air units, etc.)\r\n- AI build MCV's and deploys them, AI limitations for buildings, etc.\r\n- AI have a limit of construction yard/war factory/vessel carrier according to fast build on/off. It's more realist against a human even with a massive base\r\n- AI monitors what you are doing and uses this on how to react while upgrading / expanding his base. If you have more of building x, he builds more of x too. It's totally dynamic. :-)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- The more Tiberium is available on the map, the harder it is to beat the AI. You might need a faster PC because of the number of units etc.  :-)\r\n- AI Boost level and almost all other settings are editable using the .ini file. It's located in: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\1213210\\2221741447\\AIBoost\\CCDATA\\AIBOOST.INI\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo do / wishes:\r\n- AI Minelayer control in Skirmish\r\n- AI Chronosphere control in Skirmish\r\n- AI Iron Curtain control in Skirmish\r\n- In skirmish add new play-methods for the AI like: Turtle, Air rush, Infantry rush, Tank rush, etc.\r\n- In skirmish and not in FFA-games, the AI should be enabled to ally or declare war to change his friends and enemies\r\n- The AI should know how to send a MCV (Or other unit) into a transport and send it over water to a better location\r\n- Like in RA2 Yuri's Revenge: Units should be able to scan the area and attack a specified object while avoiding all other dangers. (Attack object from other side by driving around units and defenses)\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- Tech stealing:\r\nThe human player must re-deploy the Construction Yard to MCV and back to unlock all stolen tech. Also, for the War Factory. (Or you must build an extra one)\r\nIt also changes the voices for some countries. Currently, we don't know how to correct this\r\n\r\nSource code: (If you know how to program C++, we always can use some help with our To-do's and wishes)\r\nhttps://github.com/Bast75/CnC_Remastered_Collection-AI-Boost2\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings, have fun and don't forget to rate this mod\r\nBast75\r\nxXMini FrankiXx\r\n",

[AIBoost]
; How much do we want to boost the AI?
; This value multiplies the tiberium the AI gets on unloading a harvester
; Change the value depending on map resources or to your liking.
; Note: Humans have this set to 1. Don't set this to high, it's kind of cash cheating for the AI.
AIBoostIQLevel=4; default 4, max=10, min=1

; Give the AI-boostlevel for AI's that are friends with the human a separate level.
; Only active when AIDynamicBoostIQLevelAllowed=false and playing in teams (FFA=false)
AIBoostIQLevelForAllies=4; default 4, max=10, min=1

;To prevent to go to high or to low for dynamic levels:
AIDynamicBoostIQMax=6; default 6, max=10, min=1, AI is not allowed to go above this level.
AIDynamicBoostIQMin=3; default 3, max=10, min=1, AI is not allowed to go under this level.
; Note:
; Now it detects FFA games also. For FFA games all AI's have the same level thats set in AIBoostIQLevel.
; Meaning: During FFA -> AIDynamicBoostIQLevelAllowed=disabled

; Dynamic AI Boost Level:
; Is the AI allowed to change the boost level dynamically based on the number of allies and enemies he personally sees?
AIDynamicBoostIQLevelAllowed=true; default true
; If enabled, the AI level changes during the game based on the balance between the groups.
; equal groups -> equal levels
; large group vs small group  -> AIBoostIQLevel -1 vs AIBoostIQLevel +1
; Extreme large group vs extreme small group  -> AIBoostIQLevel -2 vs AIBoostIQLevel +2

; Note for testing we added a debug option.
; Each time a new attack wave is starting, this adds debug logging to files called 
; "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\CnCRemastered\aiboost-debug.log".
; "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\CnCRemastered\aiboost-load-settings-debug.log".
; In here you see some debug info about all AI's.
; Warning:
; Only enable it for short testing. It slows down your system.
; Also the file can really grow large. Don't forget to delete it.
AIBoostDebug=0; default 0, to enable set to 1.

; Average delay between AI attacks. Don't set it to soon, Air units must fly back to reload.
; Higher value means wait longer and also send more units in new attack.
; To high can result in more stuck/blocked units.
; Note: On each new Attack launch, all units receive a scatter command first. This to unlock stuck/blocked units.
; Note2: All chronotanks do a chronoshift at this moment also.
AIAttackInterval=5; default:5 --> Normal game speed=2m15s Highest game speed=1m18s

; Average delay before AI begins first attack. After this he will use the AIAttackInterval for the other attacks.
AIAttackFirstTime=5; default:5

; How many defense buildings must the AI have so its allowed to attack with all units? 
; Note it always keeps building new ones, so why keep some tanks, infantry, etc. in the base?
AIAttackMinimaldefenseSendUnitsPrecentageLow=80; default 80, He sends 80% of his units when not enough defense is build.
AIAttackMinimaldefenseSendUnitsPrecentageHigh=95; default 95, He sends 95% of his units when medium defense is build.
AIAttackMinimaldefenseSendUnitsSwitchLow2High=4; default 4, less defense: send Low, more defense: send High.
AIAttackMinimaldefenseSendUnitsSwitchHigh2All=8; default 8, He sends 100% of his units when enough defense is build.

; How much cash you want to add to everyone?
; Cash = In-game starting cash + AIMoreStartingCash
; Maximum: 1000000
AIMoreStartingCash=0; default 0

; How many units you want to add?
; In-game starting units + AIMoreStartingUnits
AIMoreStartingUnits=0; default 0

; No shroud On/Off(put On to remove all shroud from the map)
; Shroud will be removed when an unit is moved
AINoShroud=false; default false

; Enable/disable fast build with Aftermath units
; Normally, with Aftermath units, building speed is maxed out with 2 of the same base. Use this option to remove this limit(like in the original game)
; Note: If you enable this, limits for the Construction yard, Naval Yard and the War-factory will be increased by 2 to compensate AI behavior during fast build.
AIAftermathfastbuild=false; default false

; How many buildings can the AI build vs the Human player?
; If Human has 20 and this is set to 3. The AI can go up to 20*3=60 buildings.
AIBuildingsMultiplier=3; default 3

; You can limit the max number of Refineries by edititing the line below:
AIRefineryLimitOverwrite=8; default 8
; If his enemy has more and AIAllowDynamicBaseGrow=true, then he is allowed to go to equal number as the enemy average

; Max number of Harvesters an AI should build versus the amount of Refineries.
; Example:  Harvesters = AIHarvesterMultiplier * NrOfRefineries
; Note: Its activated after he build his first Refinery.
AIHarvesterMultiplier=1.3; default 1.3

; But never go above this number of harvesters:
AIHarvesterMaxLimit=15; default 15

; This is the percentage of that the AI swithes to Harvester hunting. Default: 5
; In each attack interval is chooses a randum number between 0 and 100, if the result is lower, then he trows all he haves at hunting Harvesters.
; Don't set this to high, the AI will not attack other things anymore. Max: 15
AIHaversterHuntMadness=5;

; When looking for refineries, the harvester will prefer a distant free
; refinery over a closer occupied refinery only if their distance
; difference in cells is smaller than this.
MaxFreeRefineryDistanceBias=20; default 20

; If a refinery is already occupied by a returning harvester and another
; harvester is also looking to dock, allow the new harvester to take over
; the refinery if the difference in distance to the refinery between
; the existing harvester and the new harvester is at least this many cells.
MinHarvesterQueueJumpDistance=7; default 7

; The maximum distance that walls will extend to when produced.
MaxWallExtensionDistance=4; default 4

; Wall extension does not automatically increase the cost of walls.
; As such, you can actually get multiple wall pieces for the price of one.
; To offset it and make it impossible to gain money by just building 
; and selling walls, a wall's regular sell price is divided by this.
WallSellPriceDivisor=3; default 3

; Should repair facilities kick out fully repaired units automatically?
AutoRepairFacilityKickOut=true; default true

; Is the AI allowed to grow his base depending on the average number of total enemy buildings? 
; If AI cam build 2 warfactories but enemy/enemies have a total of 4, then AI can go 4 also.
; This is for Barracks/Tenst, Warfactory, Shipyard, SubPen, Helipads, Airfields and defense buildings.
AIAllowDynamicBaseGrow=true; default true

; Allow instant capture by Engineers? Means no damage and just 1 engineer needed to capture a building
EngineerInstantCapture=true; default true

; Max number of Engineers to have at the same time.
AIMaxEngineers=20; default 20

; Nr of infantry combined in a group. Default 5
; Note: If EngineerInstantCapture=true, then engineers don't walk in groups. (Other infantry still uses this group-size)
InfantryGroupSize=5; default 5

; Is the AI allowed to use ChronotankGroupShifting?
; You can enable this, but its kind of cheating because human can't group chronoshift.
AIAllowChronotanksGroupShifting=false; default false
; Note: To prevent the AI for building to much Chronotanks, we set a limit on it:
AIMaxChronotanks=5; default 5

; Some extra settings/changes made by me:
; Does chronoshifting a APC kill its cargo?
ChronoKillCargo=false; default false

; MAD-TANK:
; How far must the MAD tank be from our base so its save to deploy? It starts to deploy at (first damage and far enough) OR (Far&Close enough and attack interval fires). 
AIMadTankSaveToDeployDistance=20; default 20
; How far is the closest enemy building, so we are close enough to damage it?
AIMadTankCloseEnoughToEnemyDistance=15; default 15

; Allow Allies vs Soviets steal tech from each other by sending an Engineer to capture a building.
; Note: The human player has to re-deploy the Construction Yard to MCV and back to unlock all tech. Also for the War Factory. (Or you have to build a new one)
AllowTechStealing=true; default true

; How much power must the AI build?
; If he needs 1200 power for all buildings, he makes sure he has 1200 + AIPowerPlusExtra in total power.
; Note: AIPowerPlusExtra is activated if the AI has a Radar.
; If he hasn't one he uses AIPowerPlusMinimal
AIPowerPlusMinimal=50; default 10
AIPowerPlusExtra=500; default 500
; If power above NeededPower+PowerPlus+AIPowerPlusSellValue, then we sell some power buildings.
AIPowerPlusSellValue=500; default 500

; It's a bit difficult to detect during a Naval War if we still can use ground units to attack the enemy.
; Now it scans the Human player.
; If Human(s) has more than 2 barracks/tent
; Or Human(s) has more than 2 warfactories
; Or Human(s) has more than x tank-units (AIHumanGroundWarTankTrigger) (Which are not harvesters)
; Then we assume its a ground war also.
AIHumanGroundWarTankTrigger=15; default 15

; Some limits for the AI, if his enemy has more and AIAllowDynamicBaseGrow=true, then he is allowed to go to equal number as the enemy average.
; Example: AIBarracksLimitBasic=2 but the enemy average is 4. Then he can build 4.
; Fast build games are when you play without aftermath units or with aftermath units and AIAftermathfastbuild=true
